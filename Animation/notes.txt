- `requestAnimationFrame` is a method used in JavaScript to create smooth animations.
- It tells the browser to execute a specified function before the next repaint.
- In Three.js, `requestAnimationFrame` is commonly used in the render loop to update the scene and camera continuously.
- Example usage in Three.js:
    ```javascript
    function animate() {
            requestAnimationFrame(animate);
            // Update objects or animations here
            renderer.render(scene, camera);
    }
    animate();
    ```
- It ensures efficient rendering by syncing with the display refresh rate.
- The purpose of this method is to optimize performance and provide a smoother user experience by leveraging the browser's native capabilities for rendering animations.
